CSS (Chai aur code)

This is notes for css.

Css do two main things. :-
   1. Select Element           2. Style Element


There are 3 ways in which we can inject css in a Html page.
   
**Imp: Every Element has a global attribute that is "<stype></style>" which can be used within the element to style it. 

   1. Inline Styling :- In this styling in which we style within the Element 
                        This approach is opted by tailwind css in which style the element in inline way.

   2. In head of the page:- here in this type of styling we write the styling of the full page in the head portion in 
                             <style></style> element. Here we can select the element and then we can stype it usig css.

   3. In SEPERATE file:- Here we can put our css content in a different file and then eject that file in the webpage we wanted
                         We have to include that file in head part of the webpage.


               Ways to select the element:- There are usually two ways to slect the element
                                     Using :
                                     1. ID of the element you want to select.
                                     2. CLASS of the element you wnat to Select .
                                     3. also by name of the element( This approach fails when there are more than one element with same name)

               ****IMP :
                       ID can never be same for two elements where as CLASS can be same for the tow elements
                        and we can style two elements same using same class for them.
                           
 <!--Now this approach is using selecting the element where we are selecting the element h2 and p-->
    <style>   
          h2, p{
            color:aquamarine
          }
        #h2_second {               //ID's are selected by "#" sign.
            color: antiquewhite;
        }
        .same_class{               // Classes are selected by " . " sign.
            color: blue;
        }
    
    </style>

**Very Important : Speciacity rule : in which if we change color of p in file as brown and then we are changing it to red in a different file
                   What should our browser choose?
     -------
    |     it will always select the styling that is done within the document or wihin the element itself
    |     using style="" sttribute in the element.
    |

  *** Summary: 
   I can write my styling within inline, just like this.
   I can add the classes, I can target multiple elements, or
   I can write my styles into a separate file as well
   by adding just this link to the style sheet .
   So these are three ways how you can write your css
