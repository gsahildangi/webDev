HTML : Hyper text markup Language.

<head> tag ( hold meta data of the document) : It contain data of the document. 
then we have <body> - contain visual part of the website.

<body>    body hierarcy can be like this.
   -<div></div>
     - <h1>
     -<p>

     <!DOCTYPE HTML> tell the browser that the file you about to serve is a html file also contain latest html.

<h1> Somestatement </h1> :> This collective it is called a Element.

List in Html:

orderred list and unordered list
1                       *
2                       *  
3                       *
4                       *

ul>li*3 and then hit tab
<ul attribute=""> unorderedlist 
   <li>Text item 1</li>
   <li>Text item 2</li>
   <li>Text item 3</li>
</ul>
<0l attribute=""> orderedlist 
   <li>Text item 1</li>
   <li>Text item 2</li>
   <li>Text item 3</li>
</ol>

Element:------ There are two type of Element.
1> Block Element. -> Goes from left to right in the browser as a block . Ex:<h1> is block level and take 
                                                                             full space from left to right.
2> Inline Element. -> a small image on the webpage is inlie which do not take the full space from left to right.
                                                                         Ex: image tag.

Use inspect in crome and then you will find out which one is inline and which one is block element.


 <div> // This is div that is a container for your other elements
          <h1>Block Level Elements</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Heading 1 to heading 6</li>
            <li>li ol</li>
            <li>p </li>
            <li>many more</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

Tables and formes in HTML:

Table: So in html to show the table data we use table tag which show table data on the web browser for us

Form :So to take any input data from the user we use form. We have form for HTML,Email,Password,FIle
    
      Now we enter data un table row wise.

Table Example:
      <table> //Here this table is for the table which tell browser that it is table.
             <tr>//Now as we enter data in table row wise so this is first row now lets add table heading and data in table in first row
                  <th>Name</th> Here is is table heading which will come a little bold.
                  <th>Age</th>
                  <th>Designation</th>
             </tr>            //Now all above two will be our first row will heading of the table and name first column of row 1 and age is second column for row 1.
             <tr> //Now this is row 2
                  <td>Sahil</td>//First column of row 2 // Here td is for table data
                  <td>33</td>   //Second column of row 2
                  <td>IT</td>   //Third column of row 2
             </tr>
             <tr>
                 <td>Chinmay</td>
                 <td>23</td>
                 <td>Health care</td>
             </tr>
           
      </table>

      Now this table is somewhat like this:

      Name    Age Designation    // This first row will be bold as it is <th> i.e table heading
      Sahil   33  IT
      Chinmay 23  Health care
